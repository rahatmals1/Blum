## About Proxies


You can add proxy lists in the `proxies.txt` file, and the proxy format is as follows:

If there is authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://user:password@hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://admin:admin@69.69.69.69:6969
```

If there is no authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://69.69.69.69:6969
```

Please pay close attention to whether the proxy you are using requires authentication or not, as many people DM me asking about how to use proxies.
